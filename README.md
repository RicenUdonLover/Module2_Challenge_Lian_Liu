# Module 2 Challenge

## Objective:
* Create a student portfolio that contains the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them.
* There will be a navigation bar that brings the viewer to the corresponding section.
* There will be images for the developer's previous applications, the first one needs to be bigger than the others.
* There will be links on the images that take the viewer to the deployed application.
* There will be a responsive layout that adapts different screen sizes.

## The Outcome:
* A header was made so that it is easy to see what kind of webpage it is. The site title was renamed to show the content of the site.

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/images/header.JPG" alt="The header of the webpage" title="Click for bigger image" width="50%">
</br>
</div>
</br>
</br>
</br>

* A floating navigation bar was made to take the viewer to the corresponding sections.

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/images/nav.gif" alt="A navigation bar that brings you to different sections" height="400">
</br>
</div>
</br>
</br>
</br>

* A brief introduction to the developer is added to the first section.

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/images/aboutme.JPG" alt="Some photos and texts about me" title="Click for bigger image" height="400">
</br>
</div>
</br>
</br>
</br>

* The developer's previous work were added to the second section. All the images will take the viewer to the deployed application.

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/images/work.gif" alt="A GIF to show the work and the links to deployed application" height="400">
</br>
</div>
</br>
</br>
</br>

* Links to the deployer's social media accounts were added so that the viewer can know more about the developer or contact him.

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/images/contact.gif" alt="Links to my social media accounts and my contact information" height="400">
</br>
</div>
</br>
</br>
</br>

* A back to top button was added for fun :)

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/images/back2top.gif" alt="Play with the back to top button" height="400">
</br>
</div>
</br>
</br>
</br>

* Media query was added to produce a responsive layout.
