# Module 2 Challenge

## Objective:
* Create a student portfolio that contains the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them.
* There will be a navigation bar that brings the viewer to the corresponding section.
* There will be images for the developer's previous applications, the first one needs to be bigger than the others.
* There will be links on the images that take the viewer to the deployed application.
* There will be a responsive layout that adapts different screen sizes.

## The Outcome:
* A header was made so that it is easy to see what kind of webpage it is. The site title was renamed to show the content of the site.

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/images/header.JPG" alt="The header of the webpage" title="Click for bigger image" height="400">
</br>
</div>

* A floating navigation bar was made to take the viewer to the corresponding sections.

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/images/nav.gif" alt="The header of the webpage" height="400">
</br>
</div>

* A brief introduction to the developer is added to the first section.

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/images/aboutme.jpg" alt="Some photos and texts about me" title="Click for bigger image" height="400">
</br>
</div>

* The developer's previous work were added to the second section. All the images will take the viewer to the deployed application.

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/images/work.gif" alt="The header of the webpage" height="400">
</br>
</div>
